## Quickstart

Run the project locally to view features. This project uses MarkBind for developer documentation. MarkBind is used to create a static site, and can parse markdown, GitHub Flavoured Markdown, and more.

All the commands in this document are assumed to be run from the /docs folder, unless specified otherwise.

**Installation**

1. Install Node.js (minimum version 12).
2. Run npm ci to install the necessary tools to build documentation.

Install the following additional dependencies required by MarkBind to generate PlantUML diagrams locally:

1. Install Java 8 or later.
2. Install Graphviz v2.38 (or later).

> You can also use a globally installed MarkBind if you have one. Make sure to use version 3.*.*.

**Run**

Run the following command to view the site locally:
```bash
npm run serve

#Alternative if you wish to use a globally installed MarkBind
markbind serve
```

The live preview will be available at localhost:8080 by default and should update automatically to reflect changes you make to the docs. If you wish to use another port (e.g. 8090), use the -p flag as follows:

```bash
npm run serve -- -p 8090
markbind serve -p 8090
```
